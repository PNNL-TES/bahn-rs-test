# Summary

* Problem
* Goals
* Main findings (summarized)
* Implications

# Introduction

* Robustly scaling soil respiration (Rs) across time and space is important to constrain and understand this large C flux
* However Rs is difficult to measure continuously
* It is common to use Rs measured at a single point in time to represent the average of longer time period, e.g. daily Rs or monthly Rs
* How robust is this?
* Using a global hourly soil respiration database (HGRsD), we examined the relationship between Rs measured at daily mean soil temperature and the average of 24 hours continuous measured Rs
* Soil respiration measured at daily mean soil temperature matched well with daily mean Rs (slope=1, and intercept=0).

```{r}
Rs_mat_Rs_diurnal()
```

* However, due to the non-linear relationship between Rs and temperature, soil respiration at mean temperature cannot directly represent annual soil respiration.
![Rs measured at diurnal soil temperature](SI/2. Jessens.png)

* [Bahn et al. (2010) Biogeosciences](http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-7-2147-2010) found that Rs measured at mean temperature has a clear relationship with Rs_annual, based on 80 sites worldwide
* Bahn et al. developed a exponential model to predict Rs_annual through Rs_mat (non drought stress sites: Rs_annual = 455.8 Rs_mast^1.0054; drought stress sites: Rs_annual = 436.2 Rs_mast^0.926).

![Rs measured at mean annual soil temperature](SI/3. Rs_MAT_Rs_Annual_Bahn2010.jpeg)


# The objects of this analysis are

* To examine whether Rs_mat can represent annual Rs rate using data from SRDB_V4. We have 823 [JJTODO: dynamically calculate this number] records, an order of magnitude more data than Bahn et al. (2010).
* Since long term and high spatial resolution soil temperature data are rare, test whether Rs measured at annual mean _air_ temperature (Rs_amat), or mean air temperature across 1964-2014 (mat), can predict Rs_annual robustly.
* If the current Bahn et al. (2010) does not predict Rs_annual well based on Rs_mast, we want to diagnose when and why this approach does not work.
* Finally, to update Bahn et al. (2010)'s model.

# 3. Methods

**Data**

* Use most recent version of global soil respiration database, SRDB_V4, that reports annual soil respiration `Rs_annual`
* 823 records from 253 studies [JJTODO calculate in text]
* Annual mean soil temperature (reported in the papers or can be calculated with simple assumptions)
* Air temperature (University of Daleware global precipitation and air temperature data, 1964-2014, half degree spatial resolution)

**Statistics**

* Relationship between Rs and soil temperature (SRDB_V4)
* According the the relationship between Rs and Ts, we can estimate `Rs_mat` based on the annual mean soil temperature, T_Annual, and/or MAT
* Use the Bahn model to predict `Rs_annual` based on `Rs_mat`
* Compare `Rs_annual` and `Rs_annual_bahn` to evaluate its performance across the globe

**Update Bahn model**

Update Bahn model:
* `new_model1`: only update parameters, but same model formulation
* `new_model2`: add other parameters to the model for better prediction


```{r 3.1.2 Coverage of MAP and MAT, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=4}
figA <- climate_figure( srdb_orig )
```


<!-- * As we expected, Rs_mast cannot directly used to represent Rs_annual (slope = 0.94, p<0.001, intercept = 160, p < 0.001). -->
```{r, results='show'}
# 3.2 Rs_annual vs Rs_mat, test the relationship between Rs_annual and Rs_mat
# Report updated values for Bahn (2010) relationship based on SRDB
# compare_Rs_annual_Rs_TAIR( srdb_orig )
# test intercept
```

[JJTODO: consider whether we want to use "amst" or "mast". Give the prevalance of "MAT" I feel like the latter would be clearer?]

* Based on annual mean soil temperature (amst) and relationship between Rs_annual and Ts, we estimated Rs rate at annual mean soil temperature: Rs_amst
* We then applied Bahn et al. (2010) model to predict annual soil respiration (Rs_annual_bahn), and compared Rs_annual_bahn vs Rs-annual to see how well the Bahn model predicts Rs_annual based on Rs_mast.
* The results show that Rs_annual_bahn does not well represent Rs_annual (slope=0.75, p<0.001, intercept=164, p<0.001).
* The residuals have a clear trend with standardized precipitation index change (SPI, a drought index, the smaller, the drier) and Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI, the smaller, the drier) increase.

```{r, fig.height=3.5, fig.width=9}
print(bahn_vs_new (srdb_orig, 'Rs_annual_bahn', var_title = 'Bahn (2010)', res_title = 'Residual plot')) 
```

We examined many possibilities for why the Rs_annual_bahn vs Rs_annual relationship is not 1:1.

## 3.4.1 Ts sources (MGRsD, MGRsD_TAIR, From paper, Rs_Ts_relationship)

First, we tested the effect of different soil temperature sources on the Rs_annual_bahn vs Rs_annual relationship:

* **From MGRsD** means mean annual soil temperature (amst) are from a global monthly soil respiration database, each site has more than 12 months measured soil temperature read from original papers.
* **From paper** means amst were reported from the original paper (table, figures, or description).
* **Partly from TAIR** means: some studies did not measure soil temperature all year, for those months, we predict soil temperature based on monthly air temperature (Tsoil = 2.918 + 0.829*Tair). This model was developed based on the sites which have >= 12 months soil temperature measurements.

There are 67 records for which I cannot get the soil temperature information through the above three methods. In these cases, based on the Rs_Ts_relationship and reported Rs_annual, I calculated the amst.

* The calculated amst was then compared with the annual Tair, if they are well matched (error < 5%), calculated mast were used. 
* When calculated amst and annual Tair do not match, this usually indicates a potential problem, and then I went back to the manuscript and checked.
* Whenever a paper reported annual mean Ts, I compared the reported mast and estimated mast based on the Rs_Ts_relationship, and found they are well matched. 

Generally, Ts sources do not have clear effects on the Rs_annual_bahn and Rs_annual relationship.

```{r 3.3 Ts sources and effect}
# Does TS source afffects result, function 3.2
fig_Ts <- TS_Source_test(srdb)
```

## 3.4.2 Annual Rs or Ts coverage effect

Second, we tested whether Ts and Rs coverage (e.g., 0-0.5 means Rs or Ts only measured less than 6 months, versus the entire year), but found that Ts and Rs coverage do not have significant effects on the Rs_annual_bahn vs Rs_annual relationship.

```{r 3.4.0 Rs or Ts coverage and effect}
# What's the effect of annual coverage?
# Changed function so it can test both Rs_coverage and TS coverage
plot_grid(AC_test( srdb, srdb$Annual_TS_Coverage, var_title = 'Test Ts coverage' )
          , AC_test( srdb, srdb$Annual_coverage, var_title = 'Test Rs coverage' ))

```


## 3.4.3 Effect of maximum allowed divergence between global climate data set and site-specific air temperature

Third, we tested whether maximum allowed divergence between global climate data set and site-specific air temperature affect the Rs_annual_bahn vs Rs_annual relationship.

As we throw out data points with high divergence, R2 and RSE go up and down inconsistently and by small amounts, suggesting that the Tair divergence do not have a consistent effect.

```{r 3.4.2 test divergence, fig.height= 4, fig.width=8}
results <- data.frame()
for( i in c( 6, 4, 2, 1, 0.5, 0.25 ) ) {
  dat <- filtration3( srdb_orig, i, quiet=T )
  m <- lm(Rs_annual ~ Rs_annual_bahn, data = dat)
  t_slope <- abs((summary(m)$coefficients[2, 1] - 1)/summary(m)$coefficients[2, 2])
  results <- rbind(results, data.frame(  tdiff_max=i,
                           inter <- round(summary( m )$coefficients[1,1],2),
                           slope <- round(summary( m )$coefficients[2,1],4),
                           R2 = round(summary( m )$adj.r.squared,2),
                           
                           p_inter <- round(summary(m)$coefficients[1,4],4),
                           p_slope <- round(2*pt(t_slope, m$df, lower=FALSE), 4),
                           # p_slope <- round(summary(lm( Rs_annual_bahn - 1*Rs_annual ~ Rs_annual
                           #                              , data = dat ))$coefficients[2,4],4),
                           RSE = round(summary( m )$sigma,2 ),
                           n <- length(dat[,1])
                           ) ) 
}

printlog( SEPARATOR )
colnames(results) <- c("TAIR_LTM_dev", 'intercept', 'slope','R2', "p_inter", "p_slope", 'MSE', 'n')
print( results )
results <- results[, 1:7]
d <- melt( results, id.vars=1 )
p <- qplot( TAIR_LTM_dev, value, data=d, geom=c( "point", "line" ) ) +
  facet_wrap(~variable, scales = "free", nrow = 2 ) + 
  xlab( expression('Abs diff TAIR (' * degree~C * ")") ) + 
  ggtitle ('Test effects of temperature difference between paper \nand from Delaware climate data')
print( p )
```


## 3.4.4 Effect of maximum allowed divergence between annual precipitation from paper and Del

Fourth, we also tested whether the maximum allowed divergence between the global climate data set and site-specific precipitation affects the Rs_annual_bahn vs Rs_annual relationship. In other words, does a bias in the global data affect things?

As we throw out data points with high divergence, R2 and RSE showed no large or consistent changes, suggesting that the precipitation divergence does not have a large effect.

```{r 3.4.3 test precipitation divergence, fig.height=4, fig.width=8}
results <- data.frame()
for( i in c( seq(50, 3000, 200) ) ) {
  dat <- filtration4( srdb_orig, i, quiet=T )
  m <- lm(Rs_annual ~ Rs_annual_bahn, data = dat)
  results <- rbind(results, data.frame(  pdiff_max=i,
                           inter <- round(summary( m )$coefficients[1,1],2),
                           slope <- round(summary( m )$coefficients[2,1],4),
                           R2 = round(summary( m )$adj.r.squared,2),
                           p_inter <- round(summary(m)$coefficients[1,4],4),
                           p_slope <- round(summary(lm( Rs_annual_bahn - 1*Rs_annual ~ Rs_annual, data = dat ))$coefficients[2,4],4),
                           RSE = round(summary( m )$sigma,2 ),
                           n <- length(dat[,1])
                           ) ) 
}

printlog( SEPARATOR )
colnames(results) <- c("PRECIP_MAP_dev", 'intercept', "slope", 'R2', "p_inter", 'p_slope', 'MSE', 'n')
print( results )
results <- results[, 1:7]
d <- melt( results, id.vars=1 )
p <- qplot( PRECIP_MAP_dev, value, data=d, geom=c( "point", "line" ) ) +
  facet_wrap( ~variable, scales = "free", nrow = 2 ) + 
  xlab('Abs diff precipitation (mm)' ) +
  ggtitle ('Test difference tetween precipitation \nrelorted in paper and from Delaware')
print( p )
```


We also compared:
* MAT from U. Delaware (MAT_Del) and MAT reported from the papers (a) 
* TAnnual from U. Delaware (TAnnual_Del) and annual temperature from papers (study_temp) (b)
* MAP from U. Delaware (MAP_Del) and MAP reported from the papers (c)
* PAnnual from U. Delaware (PAnnual_Del) and annual precipitation from papers (study_precip) (d)

In general, the temperature and precipitation from the University of Delaware climate data matched the data reported from publications well. This supports the idea that the divergence between global climate data set and site-specific precipitation/temperature has little to no effect.

```{r MAP from Delaware vs MAP from paper, warning = FALSE}
climate_Del_test()
```

We tested the effect of precipitation and temperature variability (quantified by standard deviation from 1961 to 2014), using multiple linear regression, with divergence as catergorical indicator. [[JJTODO: this needs to be clearer. sd of what exactly? Annual means and sums?]]

We found that they have no significant effect on the Rs_annual_bahn vs Rs_annual relationship.

```{r}
# How much variability is due to inaccuracies in the global TAIR data?
# Do ecosystems with more-variable climates exhibit different trends?
climate_variability_test( srdb, var_title_T = 'Test TAIR variability'
                          , var_title_P = 'Test precipitation variability' )
```


## 3.4.5 Test ecosystem type 

The Rs_annual_ban vs Rs_annual relationship varies among different ecosystems.

* For example, agriculture has lower slope but wetland has higher slope.
* However, it is unlikely that the data from agriculture and wetland shift the overall regression between Rs_annual_bahn vs Rs_annual away from 1:1 line.
* When we remove the Ag data, the Rs_annual_bahn vs Rs_annual regression still differs from 1:1 line.

* When we plot Ag alone, we see the Rs_annual_bahn vs Rs_annual regression in Ag does not greatly differ from the rest.
* We also examined the influential outlier points (cooks.distance > 0.5). When the outliers were removed, the regression showed no difference, indicating that outliers do not have large effects.
* Similar conclusion for wetland data.

### 3.4.7 RA- or RH-dominated effect?

A particularly interesting question is whether the Rs_annual_bahn vs Rs_annual relationship changes in sites dominated by autotrophic (RA) or heterotrophic (RH) respiration. This might be the case if, for example, one respiration source had a consistently highly temperature sensitivity.

* RA dominated sites tend to have larger intercept than RH dominated sites, but no difference in slope.

```{r}
# How do autotrophic- versus heterotrophic-dominated systems differ?
# Figure C. Difference between RA-dominated sites (RC_annual>0.5 is TRUE) 
# and RH-dominated ones (RC_annual>0.5 is FALSE).
figC <- RC_test( srdb, var_title = 'Test Ra and Rh dominated sites' )
```

We tested Q10 (temperature sensitivity) and R10 (Rs at a standardized 10 C) at RA and RH-dominated sites.

* RA dominated sites have larger Q10 (over the 0-10, 5-10, 10-20, and 0-20 soil temperature ranges) values and R10 values.

```{r, fig.height=6, fig.width=8}
# test Q10 under Ra and Rh dominant sites

Q10_3 <- Q10_test(srdb_v4, 'Q10_10_20', ' C (10-20 cm) ')
Q10_4 <- Q10_test(srdb_v4, 'Q10_0_20', ' D (0-20 cm) ')

## 3.4.9 Drought effect?

In their paper, Bahn et al. (2010) reported that drought stress significantly affected the relationship. Using our new datasets we found that:

* MAP effects on the Rs_annual_bahn vs Rs_annual relationship is very limited (p ~~ 0.05).
* The slope and intercept changes do not followed a clear pattern as MAP changes.
* MAP is not a good drought index.

```{r, warning=FALSE, fig.width=8}
climate_MAP_test (srdb_orig, 'Test MAP', 'Residual plot')
```

We then tested standardized drought index (SPI).

* SPI significantly affects Rs_annual_bahn vs Rs_annual relationship; as SPI decreases, the slope decreases, means the Bahn approach tends to overestimate Rs_annual under drought condition.

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=8}
# Does drought affects trends?
SPI_test( srdb, 'Test SPI' ) #SPI can identify the drout of a year compare to the past 50 years (1964-2014)
```

Since SPI compares annual precipitation at a site with average precipitation over a period (we used 1964-2014), it can not describe spatial drought in drought.

We thus also used another drought index, the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), to characterize spatial effects.

* PDSI significantly affects the Rs_annual_bahn vs Rs_annual relationship: as it becomes drier, the slope tend to decrease, meaning that the Bahn method overpredicts the annual flux. This is consistent with the SPI finding above.

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=8}
# Do drought effects different trends?
PDSI_test( srdb, var_title = F ) # need a new SPI data
```

# 4 Update Bhan model

The previous analysis show that Rs_annual_bahn does not well represent Rs-annual; we tested several possibilities to understand why, but no solutions were found to make the original model predict Rs_annual robustly.

It is possible that the Bahn (2010) model only used 80 sites across globel, it is not representive.
* We thus updated the Bahn (2010) model's parameters (but with same formulation, named `new1` model).
* Following Bahn (2010), and because of the test performed above, we built a model for Mediterranean (n=21), and another model for the rest of the data (n=802). [JJTODO: calculate]

[JJTODO: the graph below needs a legend--very unclear without one]

bahn_new1 <- bahn_vs_new (srdb_orig, 'Rs_annual_bahn_new1', var_title = 'Bahn (new1)', res_title = 'Residual plot')
print (bahn_new1)
```

* The results show that Rs_annual_bahn well match Rs_annual (slope = 1, p = 0.07, intercept = 30, p = 0.05 ).
* However, the residual plot show that as SPI and PDSI increase, the residual also show a increase trend, which means SPI and PDSI should be included in the model.
* We thus parameterized another model (`new2`, including SPI and PDSI as predictors).

## 4.2 Predicting Rs_annual from air temperatures

Since high resolution soil temperature is still lacking, and/or has lower accuracy than air temperature data, we want to test whether we can use Rs at annual mean air temperature (amat) or mean annual temperature (mat) to predict Rs_annual. [JJTODO: clarify the difference between these]

* The regression between Rs_annual_bahn_amat and Rs_annual falls away from the 1:1 line, with an intercept significantly different from 0 (p<0.001) and slope significantly different from 1 (p<0.001).
* Note that we tested both `new1` and `new2` models.
* Using amat or mat show no big difference, but it is surprising that using mat is slightly better than using T_Annual. [JJTODO: be consistent in terminology]

```{r, warning=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
# TAnnual, function 
bahn_new2_TAnnual <- bahn_vs_new (srdb_orig, 'Rs_annual_bahn_TAnnual', var_title = 'Bahn (new1)', res_title = 'Residual plot')
bahn_new2_MAT <- bahn_vs_new (srdb_orig, 'Rs_annual_bahn_MAT', var_title = 'Bahn (SPI_PDSI)', res_title = 'Residual plot')

print(plot_grid(bahn_new2_TAnnual, bahn_new2_MAT, nrow = 2))
```

We detected 2 outliers in the Rs_annual_bahn vs Rs_annual regression.
* Remove these two outliers significantly improved the model (slope changed from 0.78 to 0.87, intercept decreased from 222 to 157, however, p values for slope and intercept are still < 0.001).

```{r}
# remove outliers
Outlier_test(srdb_orig, 'Rs_annual_bahn_TAnnual', var_title = 'Bahn (new1)', res_title = 'Residual plot', var_outlier = 0.5)
```

[JJTODO: this is very unclear]
* We adjusted the air temperature by TAnnual_adj = 2.918+0.829*TAnnual
* MAT_adj = 2.918+0.829*MAT
* The results are better, but still not resolve the problem (p<0.05)

```{r, warning=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
# TAnnual_adj = 2.918+0.829*TAnnual, same for the MAP_Del
bahn_new2_TAnnual_adj <- bahn_vs_new (srdb_orig, 'Rs_annual_bahn_TAnnual_adj', var_title = 'Bahn (new1)', res_title = 'Residual plot')
bahn_new2_MAT_adj <- bahn_vs_new (srdb_orig, 'Rs_annual_bahn_MAT_adj', var_title = 'Bahn (SPI_PDSI)', res_title = 'Residual plot')

print(plot_grid(bahn_new2_TAnnual_adj, bahn_new2_MAT_adj, nrow = 2))
```

## 4.3 Re-simulate a model (new3)

We re-calculated soil respiration at annual mean air temperature (Rs_amat, i.e., using air temperature rather than soil temperature to calculate soil respiration).

* Then we re-simulated the relationship between Rs_annual and Rs_amat.
* Rs_annual = 729.09225 \* (Rs_amat ^ 0.46535) + 89.7789 \* spi -- Medeterrean
* Rs_annual = 588.618 \* ( Rs_amat ^ 0.65022 ) + 22.59026 \* spi + 11.29775*pdsi -- exclude Mediterranean sites
* If we update the model, Rs_annual_bahn_amat can represent Rs_annual.

# 5. Discussion & questions

* The red dots are Rs measured from Mediterranean
* The blue dots are Rs measured from other biomes
* Red and blue solid lines are new1 models for Mediterranean and exclude-Mediterranean, respectively [JJTODO: what? confusing]
* Red and blue dashed lines are Bhan (2010) models for Mediterranean and exclude-Mediterranean, respectively [JJTODO: what? confusing]

These results have a direct bearing on two important problems for Rs and more generally carbon-cycle measurement and modeling:
* We have many more measurements Rs in mid-latitude regions and developed countries.Less-developed countries are constrained by lack of resources, and thus we do not have enough measurements from spouth hetmesphere, arctic, and tropical regions [(Xu and Shang 2016)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2016.08.007)
* It is difficult to measure soil respiration all year around in cold regions, but critical because of high rates of climate change and large soil C stocks


![Global spatial distribution of soil respiration sites](SI/1. SRDB_V4_Fig1.png)

We show that Rs measured at annual mean temperature (soil temperature or air temperature) can represent Rs_annual well, with well-quantified errors. This capability could be used to improve Rs measure frequency and greatly decrease cost, which becomes more important in the southern hemisphere and cold regions. 

# 6. More analysis in the future

* Using this approach to estimate global Rs, and Rs trend? see how it differ from traditional approach （Rs~Ts relationship).
* But, in order to predict global Rs using this approach, we need a uniform model to estimate Rs_amat (because for most sites, we do not have a site-scale-specific Rs~temp relationship).
* We can also using random forest model, in this case, we do not need a relationship to calculate Rs_amat.

* Using Rs_amat (or Rs_mst) predict Rh_annual?

* 1 Using SD information with boosting?
* 2 Think about application
