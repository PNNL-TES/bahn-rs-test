# 1. The spatial destribution of global Rs sites showed that we have much more measured data from the middle latitude region
* It is difficult to measure soil respiration all year around in the cold region
* Developed contries most located at Middle latitude region, thus recieved more funds to support the Rs measurements 

![Global spatial destribution of soil repiration sites](SRDB_V4_Fig1.png)

# 2. It is obvious that Rs measurements from cold region is more importent, but how?
Improve the Rs measure equipment so it can measure Rs in cold condition;
Increasing funds;
**Bahn's approach** [Bahn et al. (2004) Biogeosciences]
+ Rs measured at annuam mean temperature linearly related with annual Rs rate
+ Rs at mean temperature: soil respiration measured at annual mean temperature / monthly mean temperature / daily mean temperature

# 3. The object of this analysis are
* Whether Rs measured at annuam mean temperature can represent annual Rs rate
* Whether Rs measured at monthly mean temperature can represent monthly mean Rs?
* Whether Rs measured at daily mean temperature represent daily mean Rs?

* When well represent and when not?
* If not what is the mechanism?

# 4. Results

4.1 Data used from SRDB_V4
* Climate space figure

# 5. More analysis in the future
