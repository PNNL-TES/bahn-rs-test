Notes for Bahn analysis


TO DO: rework srdb-support.xlsx with new model names
TO DO: rework analysis to use NCEP/NCAR climate data (R package)?

======================================
10 June 2011

	First step is to go through and put in as many models as possible
		QC: screwy values, outliers, etc.
		Working on this
	
	MB's two hypotheses:
	
	"I would (quickly) hypothesize that the reported relationship should be tighter the less pronounced seasonality (esp. as concerns water availability) and the higher the Rh/Ra ratio is."

======================================
14 June 2011

	Put in a warning if LU_MAT is outside of model's temperature range
	We're now computing sd( moisture index ) per MB's quick hypothesis
	
	Continue to look at individual studies' data based on md (model diagnostic) plots
	
	Showing up with very high residuals:
	
	Record	Study	Author		Diff			Influential?
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	1577			Valentini	1600 (+60%)		Yes; formal outlier
		CHECK THIS
	1495	1539	Wang		1000 (+67%)		No
		Dry grassland, linear, 1560 obs versus 2600 pred; checked
	3406	5247	Yan			900 (+78%)		No; checked
	2439/40	3647	Vose		~700 (+33%)		Yes; checked
		Could 2439 and 2440 Rs_annuals have been flipped? :(
	3852	5587	Misson		80 (+10%)		No
	1346-8	3344	G-Guay		500 (-53%)		No
		Very high Rs; perhaps email DGG
	1543
	869,72			Drewitt		
	
	To do: go through above table and double-check
	Go through script output and double-check warnings/errors


======================================
8 December 2011

	That's interesting: predicted points w/ mtr_out=T have a poorer fit
		i.e. if model temp range doesn't encompass MAT, worse performance
	Working my way through errors and warnings
		...corrected all unknown units and models
		Currently this model: R10 (L&T), R=a exp(b((1/c)-(1/(T-d)))
			is inconsistently enterd; seems like C some places, K others?
	Hmm, what's going on with power function? Look at all this with fresh eyes
	Finish this up!
	
======================================
13 December 2011

	The residual plot for basic Rs_annual_pred ~ Rs_annual has bit of a fan shape. Investigated transformations:
	-log(x) and log(y) both look terrible
	-log-log a little better but still problems in residuals and normal Q-Q
	-sqrtx looks bad
	-sqrty is pretty good
	-sqrt-sqrt is pretty good

======================================
Call with Michael Bahn 12-17-12

1. Talk with Kali about piggybacking on vacation to go to his extremes workshop
	- Innsbruck
	- by end of Thursday

2. MB proposal
	- send more comprehensive feedback this week

3. Send manuscript to him for friendly review
	- potential confounding factors - be clear about them

4. Rs analysis - for March 1
	- commit to a week of high-time

5. Rh workshop
	- more important to write something more fundamental about Rh
	- don't believe can measure Rh at all
	- constrain Rh - how?
	- not ignoring it, though
	- build on HÃ¶gberg et al.
	
6. Proposal possibility: intact cores -> can you estimate Rh?
	- one possibility for a future proposal
	- i.e. incubate at MAT
	- process-based approach

Re SRDB analysis

I will try to have outline, etc., over next six weeks (end of October)
Things to pursue:
-- CMIP5 data
-- Mark studies with year-round measurements? (strict independence)
-- Ra studies not as good a match -> phenological bias/influence?
-- residual as indication of how much Ra influenced by phenology/contributes to Rs?

Workshop papers!!!
-- get rolling
-- synergy with other paper - !

======================================
2 January 2014

Have been revising scripts, incorporating new version of SRDB
TODO: compute new Bahn equation correctly
TODO: in climate figure, what's the "Agriculture" point with MAP=0?
TODO: deviation graph shows incorrect "0" point
	- for points with Study_temp filled in, what are outliers? Can we explain those?

======================================
6 January 2014

Looking at points with large errors (relatively and/or absolutely) that aren't due to mismatches between global climate data and local conditions (i.e., TAIR_dev < 0.5).
Steps:
	- are lat/long correct?
	- is Rs_annual correct?
	- check equation parameters
	- check for equation temperature limits
	- check what's computed by #2 script; does Rs in native units make sense?
	- units conversion problem?

Fixed studies by Pearson (wrong Rs_annual), Sanderman (eqn params wrong), Zerva and Tian (not site-specific parameters), Nishimura (agriculture), Conant, Froment, Kotroczo (soda lime). McDowell has big error but don't see a problem (ah, no, used his exponential instead of linear relationship; much better). 

Zu and Jia from Maoershan report very high Rs_annual numbers for such a cold site, and for now I'm simply excluding them. -update: checked with author and they say numbers are OK

Also: Richards #5021 (no site-specific equation)

To do
	finish checking most problematic points
	also see Jan 2nd todo list above
	re-do report for Michael
